# BMI Calculator

## Introduction

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical measure of a person's body weight in relation to their height. It is a useful screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

This BMI calculator utilizes this formula to provide an estimation of your BMI and categorize it according to standard thresholds.

## Staying Healthy

Maintaining a healthy BMI is essential for overall well-being. Here are general guidelines based on BMI categories:

- **Underweight (BMI < 18.5):**
  - Individuals may be advised to gain weight to reach a healthier range.
  - Examples: A 25-year-old female with a weight of 45 kg and height of 160 cm.

- **Normal Weight (18.5 <= BMI < 25):**
  - Considered a healthy weight range.
  - Examples: A 30-year-old male with a weight of 70 kg and height of 175 cm.

- **Overweight (25 <= BMI < 30):**
  - Individuals may be advised to lose weight to reduce the risk of health issues.
  - Examples: A 40-year-old male with a weight of 85 kg and height of 170 cm.

- **Obese (BMI >= 30):**
  - Higher risk of various health conditions.
  - Examples: A 35-year-old female with a weight of 100 kg and height of 160 cm.

It's important to note that BMI is a screening tool, and other factors such as muscle mass, distribution of fat, and overall health should also be considered when assessing an individual's health.
