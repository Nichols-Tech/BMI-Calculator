# BMI-Calculator


Description:
This **BMI calculator** is a simple Python script that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on user input of weight and height. It provides an assessment of whether the individual falls under the categories of **underweight**, **normal**, **overweight**, or **obese** based on the calculated BMI value.

The script prompts the user to input their weight in kilograms (# Type your weight in kg on line 1) and height in centimeters (# Type your height in cm on line 2). It then calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height/100)^2. The BMI value is rounded to two decimal places.

The code is designed to be easy to understand and modify. It includes input validation and provides helpful prompts to guide the user through the process. The BMI thresholds for categorization (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) are defined as constants for easy customization.

This BMI calculator serves as a useful tool for individuals who want to assess their body mass index and gain insights into their weight status. It can be utilized in health and fitness applications, medical research, and personal health monitoring projects.
